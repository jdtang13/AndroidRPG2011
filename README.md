A small Android RPG called "GigaRPG" I made in Java in 2011, as a sophomore in high school. The main character moves left and right via the on-screen arrow controls. Combat is done by tapping the screen to generate mana spheres, which deal damage to monsters on the screen. Monsters produce experience points when they die, which allow the player to level up, increasing damage, HP, and mana. As the play progresses in the game, the monsters become more and more difficult to kill.
